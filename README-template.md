## My process
It took me a little work to fix the image on the card but everything else was easy for me.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reviewed concepts that I already had and learned how to use box-shadow in CSS

### Continued development
For future projects I would like to learn more about CSS properties and animations. With this I could build better websites

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for some styles that I didn't remember or styles that I didn't know like box.shadow.
